# Webstack monitoring challenge
You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure is a famous saying in the
Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems
are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many
tools to measure what is going on our servers.

## Topics
- Why is monitoring needed
- What are the 2 main area of monitoring
- What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
- What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:
- Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making
  sure it is behaving as expected
- Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and
  making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network
  overload)
